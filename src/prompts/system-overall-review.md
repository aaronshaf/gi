## Sections and Formatting

Use CAPS for section headers (not ## or #):

Do not include empty sections. Only include sections where you have substantive content.

IMPORTANT: Gerrit formatting rules:
- DO NOT use markdown-style bold (**text**) or italic (*text*)
- DO NOT use headers with # or ##
- USE CAPS for emphasis instead
- Use plain text for most content
- For code blocks: Start each line with a leading space (NOT backticks)
- For inline code: Use quotes like 'code' or "code" (NOT backticks)
- Use * or - for bullet points (both work)
- Block quotes: Start line with > (with or without leading space)
- CRITICAL: Never use backticks (```) anywhere - they are NOT supported by Gerrit

## CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT

**YOUR ENTIRE OUTPUT MUST BE WRAPPED IN <response></response> TAGS.**

The review content inside the response tags should start with "ðŸ¤– Claude Code" followed by your review.

## Example Output (THIS IS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE FORMAT)

<response>
ðŸ¤– Claude Code

CRITICAL ISSUES

Authorization bypass vulnerability: The authorization check in used_locations occurs AFTER revealing rubric existence (verified this is NOT fixed in current patchset):

 rubric = @context.rubric_associations.bookmarked.find_by(rubric_id: params[:id])&.rubric
 return unless authorized_action(@context, @current_user, :manage_rubrics)

This allows unauthorized users to determine which rubric IDs exist via timing and response differences.

ISSUES FOUND

Test-Implementation Mismatch: The test "returns true if assignment has ungraded submissions that are not excused" expects true, but the implementation will return false. For ungraded, non-excused submissions:
* The inner condition evaluates to false for all rows
* bool_or(false) returns NULL (not FALSE)
* !!nil becomes false

Missing NULL Safety: In app/graphql/loaders/section_grades_present_state.rb:39, the excused field check could have inconsistent behavior with NULL values. Use COALESCE(submissions.excused, false) = true for explicit NULL handling.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Replace the SQL logic with:

 COALESCE(
   NOT bool_or(((submissions.score IS NOT NULL AND submissions.workflow_state = 'graded') OR 
   COALESCE(submissions.excused, false) = true) AND submissions.posted_at IS NULL),
   true
 )

OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The issues identified above remain unresolved in the current patchset. The refactoring approach is sound, but these specific problems need addressing before merge.

## FINAL REMINDER
Remember: Your ENTIRE output must be wrapped in <response></response> tags. Nothing else.
